# Discretisation of the Helmholtz decomposition using the shallow water equations

This code is supplimentary to the note by Risley et al. (2025) 'A note on the discrete representation of the
Helmholtz decomposition in ocean applications' currently in the works.

To run the code simply run 'main.py'. 

This will load the model increments and decompose the velocity increments into their irrotational and nondivergent parts. There is an option in 'main.py' to applying the Shapiro filter to the nondivergent part, or not.
